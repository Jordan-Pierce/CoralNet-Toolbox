# Semantic Segmentation
The Semantic Segmentation is a set of tools that can be used to train a model for semantic segmenation using the images and annotations downloaded from CoralNet, or those that you create using the Patch_Extractor tool.

To use the Semantic Segmentation, you will need to first download the images and annotations from CoralNet using the CoralNet_Crawler tool, or create your own annotations using the Patch_Extractor tool.

Once you have the images and annotations, you can use the Semantic Segmentation tools to train a machine learning model to classify the images based on the annotations.
