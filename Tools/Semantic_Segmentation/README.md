# Semantic Segmentation

The Semantic_Segmentation tools available in the CoralNet repository provide a means to train a machine learning algorithm to perform semantic segmentation on annotated images of coral reefs. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a label to every pixel in an image to identify the object or feature it represents. In the context of coral reefs, this could involve segmenting an image to identify different coral species or other features present.

The Semantic_Segmentation tool uses patch-based segmentation, which means that the segmentation is performed on small image patches rather than the entire image. This approach allows for greater flexibility in the segmentation process and can lead to more accurate results.

To use the Semantic_Segmentation tool, users first need to download annotated images from CoralNet or create their own using the Patch_Extractor tool. The Semantic_Segmentation tool then takes these images and their corresponding annotations and trains a machine learning model to perform semantic segmentation based on the features present.

Users can specify which features they want the model to segment during the training process. They can also set various parameters for the training process, such as the number of training epochs and the learning rate.

Once the model has been trained, it can be used to automatically segment new images based on the features present. This can be useful for analyzing large datasets of images and identifying trends or patterns that may be difficult to discern manually.

The Semantic_Segmentation tool can be particularly useful for researchers studying coral reefs, as it allows them to quickly and accurately segment large datasets of annotated images. This information can be used to gain insights into the distribution of different coral species and the factors that may be affecting their populations.
