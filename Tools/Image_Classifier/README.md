# Image Classifier
The Image Classifier is a set of tools that can be used to train a patch-based image classifier using the images and annotations downloaded from CoralNet, or those that you create using the Patch_Extractor tool.

To use the Image Classifier, you will need to first download the images and annotations from CoralNet using the CoralNet_Crawler tool, or create your own annotations using the Patch_Extractor tool.

Once you have the images and annotations, you can use the Image_Classifier tools to train a machine learning model to classify the images based on the annotations.
