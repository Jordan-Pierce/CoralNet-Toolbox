CoralNet_3D is a set of tools in the CoralNet repository that allows users to represent single 
images as 3D point clouds. This tool uses MiDAS (Masked-based Depth Estimation) to generate depth 
maps for each image and then converts the images into 3D point clouds with RGB color component 
values coming from the original images. The resulting point clouds can be visualized and analyzed 
to gain insights into the structure of coral reefs and their inhabitants.

The CoralNet_3D tool can be particularly useful for analyzing the 3D structure of coral reefs and 
the distribution of different species. By creating 3D point clouds from annotated images, 
researchers can gain a better understanding of the spatial relationships between different coral 
species and their habitats. This information can be used to inform conservation efforts and help 
protect these vital ecosystems.

The CoralNet_3D tool can also be used to visualize annotated images in a more immersive way than 
traditional 2D images. The 3D point clouds can be rotated and viewed from different angles, 
allowing researchers to explore the images in greater detail and gain a deeper understanding of the 
features present.

Overall, CoralNet_3D is a powerful tool that adds an extra dimension to the analysis of annotated 
images of coral reefs. By creating 3D point clouds from these images, researchers can gain new 
insights into the structure and distribution of coral reefs and their inhabitants.
