# Image Classifier

The Image_Classifier is a set of tools available in the CoralNet repository that can be used to 
train an image classifier on annotated images of coral reefs. The tool allows users to classify 
images based on the presence of specific features or coral species. The resulting classifier can 
be used to analyze new images and classify them automatically based on the features present in the 
images.

The Image_Classifier tool uses patch-based classification, which means that the classifier is 
trained to recognize specific features or species based on small image patches rather than the 
entire image. This approach allows for greater flexibility in the classification process and can 
lead to more accurate results.

To use the Image_Classifier tool, users first need to download annotated images from CoralNet or 
create their own using the Patch_Extractor tool. The Image_Classifier tool then takes these images 
and their corresponding annotations and trains a machine learning model to recognize specific 
features or coral species.

Users can specify which features or species they want the classifier to recognize during the 
training process. They can also set various parameters for the training process, such as the 
number of training epochs and the learning rate.

Once the classifier has been trained, it can be used to automatically classify new images based on 
the features present. This can be useful for analyzing large datasets of images and identifying 
trends or patterns that may be difficult to discern manually.

The Image_Classifier tool can be particularly useful for researchers studying coral reefs, as it 
allows them to quickly and accurately classify large datasets of annotated images. This information 
can be used to gain insights into the distribution of different coral species and the factors that 
may be affecting their populations.
