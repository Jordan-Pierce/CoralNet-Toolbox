### **About CoralNet**
Coral reefs are vital ecosystems that support a wide range of marine life and provide numerous 
benefits to humans. However, they are under threat due to climate change, pollution, overfishing, 
and other factors. CoralNet is a platform designed to aid researchers and scientists in studying 
these important ecosystems and their inhabitants.

CoralNet allows users to upload photos of coral reefs and annotate them with detailed information 
about the coral species and other features present in the images. The platform also provides tools 
for analyzing the annotated images, such as image classification and semantic segmentation.

### **Tools Available in this Repository**
This repository contains a collection of tools that can be used to interact with CoralNet and 
perform various tasks related to analyzing the annotated images. The following is a list of the 
tools currently available:

#### **CoralNet_API**
CoralNet_API is a Python library for accessing the CoralNet API, which allows users to 
programmatically interact with CoralNet and perform tasks such as uploading and downloading data, 
and annotating images. This library can be used to automate tasks and integrate CoralNet 
functionality into other applications.

#### **Patch_Extractor**
Patch_Extractor is a tool for dividing annotated images into smaller patches, which can be useful 
for training machine learning models on the annotated data. This tool can be used to generate 
training datasets for image classification or semantic segmentation.

#### **How to use**
To use these tools, you need to have access to the CoralNet platform. Once you have an account, 
you can use the CoralNet_API library to programmatically interact with the platform and perform 
various tasks.

### **Conclusion**
In summary, this repository provides a range of tools that can assist with interacting with 
CoralNet and performing various tasks related to analyzing annotated images. These tools can be 
useful for researchers and scientists working with coral reefs, as well as for students and
hobbyists interested in learning more about these important ecosystems.
