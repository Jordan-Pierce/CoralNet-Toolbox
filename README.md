The `CoralNet-Toolbox` is an unofficial codebase that can be used to augment processes associated with those on
[CoralNet](https://coralnet.ucsd.edu/). It uses ‚ú®[`Ultralytics`](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)üöÄ as a 
base, which is an open-source library for computer vision and deep learning built in `PyTorch`. For more information on
their `AGPL-3.0` license, see [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/LICENSE). It also uses [`SAM`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) and [`MobileSAM`](https://github.com/ChaoningZhang/MobileSAM) for polygon creation.

## Quick Start

Running the following command will install the `coralnet-toolbox`, which you can then run from the command line:
```bash
# cmd

# Install
pip install "git+https://github.com/Jordan-Pierce/CoralNet-Toolbox.git"

# Run 
coralnet-toolbox
```

For further instructions, see [How to Install](); for information on how to use, check out the [docs](./docs).

## **How to Install**

### Anaconda

It's recommended to use `Anaconda` to create an environment for the `toolbox`:
```bash
# cmd

# Create and activate an environment
conda create --name coralnet-toolbox python=3.8 -y
conda activate coralnet-toolbox
```
### CUDA
Once this has finished, if you have `CUDA`, you should install the versions of `cuda-nvcc` and `cudatoolkit` that you 
need, and then install the corresponding versions of `torch` and `torchvision`:
```bash
# cmd

# Example for CUDA 11.8
conda install cuda-nvcc -c nvidia/label/cuda-11.8.0 -y
conda install cudatoolkit=11.8 -c nvidia/label/cuda-11.8.0 -y

# Example for torch 2.0.0 and torchvision 0.15.1 w/ CUDA 11.8
pip install torch==2.0.0+cu118 torchvision==0.15.1+cu118 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```
If `CUDA` is installed on your computer, and `torch` was built with it properly, you should see a `üêá` icon in the 
`toolbox` instead of a `üê¢`; if you have multiple `CUDA` devices available, you should see a `üöÄ` icon, 
and if you're using a Mac with `Metal`, you should see an `üçé` icon.

See here for more details on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) versions.

### Install

Finally, install and run the `toolbox`:
```bash
# cmd

# Install
pip install "git+https://github.com/Jordan-Pierce/CoralNet-Toolbox.git"

# Run
coralnet-toolbox
```

## GitHub Repository

If you prefer to clone the repository and run the `toolbox` from the source code, you can do so with the following after
creating an `Anaconda` environment:

```bash
# cmd

# Clone and enter the repository
git clone https://github.com/Jordan-Pierce/CoralNet-Toolbox.git
cd CoralNet-Toolbox

# Install the latest
pip install -e .

# Run
coralnet-toolbox
```

## What Happened to the Old Repository?

The previous repository can be found in the [Toolshed](toolshed/README.md) folder. The instructions for installing and 
running the `toolshed` are the same as above; after creating an `Anaconda` environment, you can install the `toolshed` 
with the following link:

```bash
# cmd

# Change directories
cd CoralNet-Toolbox/toolshed

# Install the latest
pip install -e .

# Run
python main.py
```
Alternatively, you can work with the functions within a script:
```python
# python

import argparse
from coralnet_toolshed.Download import download

# Create an empty parser
args = argparse.Namespace()

# Add an argument
args.username = "username"
args.password = "password"
args.source_id = 3420

# Run the function
download(args)
```
And also command line:
```bash
python coralnet_toolshed/Download.py --username username --password password --source_id 3420
```

## [**About CoralNet**](https://coralnet.ucsd.edu/source/)
Coral reefs are vital ecosystems that support a wide range of marine life and provide numerous 
benefits to humans. However, they are under threat due to climate change, pollution, overfishing, 
and other factors. CoralNet is a platform designed to aid researchers and scientists in studying 
these important ecosystems and their inhabitants.

CoralNet allows users to upload photos of coral reefs and annotate them with detailed information 
about the coral species and other features present in the images. The platform also provides tools 
for analyzing the annotated images, and create patch-based image classifiers. 

The CoralNet Toolbox is an unofficial tool developed to augment processes associated with analyses that 
use CoralNet and Coral Point Count (CPCe).


## **Conclusion**
In summary, this repository provides a range of tools that can assist with interacting with 
CoralNet and performing various tasks related to analyzing annotated images. These tools can be 
useful for researchers and scientists working with coral reefs, as well as for students and
hobbyists interested in learning more about these important ecosystems.
