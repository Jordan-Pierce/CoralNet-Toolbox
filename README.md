### **About CoralNet**
Coral reefs are vital ecosystems that support a wide range of marine life and provide numerous 
benefits to humans. However, they are under threat due to climate change, pollution, overfishing, 
and other factors. CoralNet is a platform designed to aid researchers and scientists in studying 
these important ecosystems and their inhabitants.

CoralNet allows users to upload photos of coral reefs and annotate them with detailed information 
about the coral species and other features present in the images. The platform also provides tools 
for analyzing the annotated images, and create patch-based image classifiers. 

### **Tools**

The `CoralNet-Toolbox` is an unofficial codebase that can be used to augment processes associated
with those on CoralNet, including:
- `API`: Easily use the CoralNet API to get predictions from any source model
- `Download`: Download all data associated with a source
- `Upload`: Upload images, annotations, and labelsets to a source
- `Labelset`: Create a custom labelset
- `Viscore`: Upload annotations made in Viscore's VPI to CoralNet
- `Classifier`: Create your own patch-based image classifier, locally
- `Annotate`: Create your own patches, locally
- `Visualize`: Visualize points, patches superimposed on images
- `Patches`: Extract patches from images given an annotation file
- `Points`: Sample points from images (Uniform, Random, Stratified)
- `Inference`: Perform inference using a locally trained model

#### **Future Features**
- `Analysis`: Calculate CPCe statistics from locally trained model's predictions
- `Clean`: Use `CleanLab.ai` to identify potentially incorrectly labeled patches
- `Segment`: Create segmentation masks for each image using `MSS`, `SAM`
- `GAN`: Synthesize samples using generative AI

#### **How to use**
To use these tools, you should have access to the CoralNet platform. Once you have an account, 
you can use the `CoralNet-Toolbox` codebase to programmatically interact with the platform and perform 
various tasks.

To install, use the `coralnet_toolbox.yml` file using anaconda:
```python
# cmd
conda env create -f coralnet_toolbox.yml
conda activate coralnet_toolbox
python Toolbox\toolbox.py
```

### **Conclusion**
In summary, this repository provides a range of tools that can assist with interacting with 
CoralNet and performing various tasks related to analyzing annotated images. These tools can be 
useful for researchers and scientists working with coral reefs, as well as for students and
hobbyists interested in learning more about these important ecosystems.
