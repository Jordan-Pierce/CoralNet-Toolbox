# CoralNet_Tools  

This repository contains tools that can help with interacting with CoralNet, a platform for studying and annotating coral reefs. CoralNet allows users to upload and organize photos of coral reefs, and to annotate them with detailed information about the coral species and other features present in the images. The tools in this repository can assist with tasks such as importing and exporting data from CoralNet, and performing analysis on the annotated images.  

Current tools include:  

- `CoralNet_API` - A Python library for accessing the CoralNet API, which allows users to programmatically interact with CoralNet and perform tasks such as uploading and downloading data, annotating images, and managing user accounts.  
- `CoralNet_Crawler` - A tool for automatically downloading large numbers of images and annotations from CoralNet, using a customizable set of search criteria. 
- `Patch Extractor` - A tool for dividing annotated images into smaller patches, which can be useful for training machine learning models on the annotated data.
